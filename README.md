link to download weights and the converted models to onnx: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Unj7DZi6ACGsUVmSunDPM2WcnvRXBHrv?usp=sharing
the weights file tomp101.pth.tar should be moved into pytracking-master/pytracking/networks/
The entire pytracking-master file has to be inside D:\pyth\pytracking-master\ or else NOTHING WILL WORK!!!
